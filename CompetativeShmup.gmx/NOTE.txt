**In the enemy type that releases the basic attack, set the appropriate player object's alarm 1 to the time between hitting the
enemy and releasing the attack.

**As we add ship/item type names be sure to update the readProfile script's comments with their actual code names so we don't lose which array
slot is which.

**BUG** If you are hit by a bullet while the enemy who shot the bullet is still alive the game crashes
